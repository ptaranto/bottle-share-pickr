# Bottle-Share-Pickr app by Pedro Taranto

This app uses the Unttapd API to help you select a beer to bring to a bottle share.

The idea is to pre-select a few friends (up to 5) and when retrieving a beer info, displays which of the selected friends had already had this beer or not to be able to evaluate if it's a good candidate to share with friends.
